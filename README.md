RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification

Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, affecting 619 million people in 2020. Most people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, with the frequency increasing with age. Pain and restricted mobility are often symptoms of spondylosis, a set of degenerative spine conditions including degeneration of intervertebral discs and subsequent narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis), subarticular recesses, or neural foramen with associated compression or irritations of the nerves in the low back.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a detailed view of the lumbar spine vertebra, discs, and nerves, enabling radiologists to assess the presence and severity of these conditions. Proper diagnosis and grading of these conditions help guide treatment and potential surgery to help alleviate back pain and improve overall health and quality of life for patients.

About the Challenge

This project utilizes the Google Colab Pro version with GPU for efficient training and experimentation.

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), in collaboration with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), has launched this competition to explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting and classifying degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MRI images.

Objective

The challenge focuses on classifying five lumbar spine degenerative conditions:

Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing

Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing

Left Subarticular Stenosis

Right Subarticular Stenosis

Spinal Canal Stenosis

Each imaging study in the dataset includes severity scores (Normal/Mild, Moderate, or Severe) for these five conditions across the intervertebral disc levels L1/L2, L2/L3, L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1.

Dataset

The ground truth dataset for this challenge has been expertly curated by a multi-institutional planning task force, sourcing imaging data from eight sites across five continents. This dataset aims to:

Improve standardized classification of degenerative lumbar spine conditions.

Enable the development of tools to automate accurate and rapid disease classification.
